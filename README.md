If you finish early with this homework, go ahead and prepare for [next week](https://github.com/wearecodets/phase-two/tree/master/week-three).

## Getting Started

If it's your first time working on this project, run `npm install`. Otherwise, just `npm start` to begin working.

**Do not modify `index.html` or `.scss` files in `src/stylesheets`. Your code should only be in `src/main.js`.**

## Branching Rules

1. Never work directly on the `master` branch. 
2. `origin/master` always represents the latest code deployed to production (Netlify).
2. Create a new branch for each homework topic. 
3. Prefix your branch with `feature-` to work on new features. For example, `feature-accordion`.
4. Prefix your branch with `fix-` to work on bug fixes. For example, `fix-paypal`.

## Directions

### 1. Deploy to Production

Connect this Github repo's `master` branch to Netlify and customize the domain URL to have the same name as this homework repo â€“ for example: `http://hw2-niko.netlify.com`. From now on, every merged PR triggers a deployment to this URL. When you are done, [add a status badge](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#status-badges) below this line:

### 2. Payment Total Bug

Many angry customers reported that the payment form only shows zero amount despite the payment plan selected (annually or monthly). Your boss told you to debug the issue so the company can start making money again. He wanted to make sure that the total amount is calculated correctly. Additionally, he said that the total needs to show up in two different places in the form.

### 3. Form Submit Bug

The boss complained that the Pay button is unclickable. He said that it makes sense if customers have not selected any payment plansâ€”but after the total is calculated, this bug is unacceptable and must be immediately fixed!

### 3. PayPal Amount Bug

Apparently, some loyal customers would still love to give the company money by using the PayPal link. However, many felt cheated when they found out the crazy amount of $1,234 was [hard coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding) in the `href` attribute of the link. *"Fix it!"* said the boss.

### 5. Implement Accordion Feature

After all the unforseen events, you decided be more self-initiative to win back your boss' favor. So, you asked your coworkers to build you a nifty little [FAQ section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ) on the left side of the form. 

Your friends thought [accordions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion_(GUI)) are the way to go for FAQs so they went ahead with the markup and styling in a branch called `feature-accordion`. They told you to `checkout` the branch and  continue the JavaScript part.
